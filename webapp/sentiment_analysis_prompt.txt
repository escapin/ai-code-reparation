"Decide if a given customer review is [VERY POSITIVE / POSITIVE / NEUTRAL / NEGATIVE / VERY NEGATIVE].\n\nCustomer Review: \n\"I was sent another headboard and the new one doesn't squeak!! I am so excited. The only issue I had with it, was that it was squeaking at every movement. But the new one doesn't do that, and it was not a hassle to get the new one. It is a beautiful bedframe. Definitely recommend now that my issue has been resolved. Very pleased!!\"\nSentiment Analysis Result: VERY POSITIVE\n\nCustomer Review: \n\"The bed looks beautiful and is easy to assemble. However the mattress is rather uncomfortable. It is a mixed bag. Would buy it again, but only if it is on offer.\"\nSentiment Analysis Result: NEUTRAL\n\nCustomer Review: ",
